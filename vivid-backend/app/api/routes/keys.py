"""Developer API keys: the self-serve half of the partner API.

Someone who wants to build on Vivid signs in, opens Settings → Developer, and
generates a key here. That key then works on every `/v1` endpoint the app
itself uses, because `deps.get_principal` resolves a key and a session token
to the same `Principal`.

Two rules shape this module:

**A key acts as its own service account, never as the person who made it.**
The partner's chats, attachments and browser sessions belong to a dedicated
user row, so they never appear in the developer's own sidebar, and revoking a
key never touches anyone else's data. `owner_user_id` records the human, and
is what these endpoints scope to.

**A key cannot manage keys.** Every route here takes `get_session_user`, which
refuses an API key. Otherwise a leaked key would outlive its own revocation:
the holder would simply mint a replacement first.
