"""OpenAI-compatible passthrough to a pod, on behalf of an authenticated user.

`llm.py` next door is the product's own adapter: it decides the prompt, the
temperature and the tool loop. This module decides none of those — the caller
is an agent running on someone's laptop and it has its own opinions. What this
adds over letting that agent reach the pod itself is the part the pod cannot
do: a Vivid identity on every call, a model alias instead of a vendor string,
a ceiling on one reply, and a token count that comes back for the ledger.
