# Vivid backend

The single backend between the web client and the model services on RunPod
(spec: `vivid-backend-spec.md`). Nothing talks to RunPod except this service.

## Run

```bash
cp .env.example .env            # repo root — fill in the RunPod URLs
docker compose up --build       # from the repo root
```

API at http://localhost:8000 (docs at `/docs`), MinIO console at
http://localhost:9001 (minioadmin/minioadmin).

## Layout

```
app/
  core/        config (env), JWT + password hashing
  db/          SQLAlchemy models (users, clients, chats, messages,
               attachments, message_embeddings) + engine/init
  api/routes/  /v1 REST: auth, chats, attachments, search, health
  ws/          /ws — the one websocket per browser session
  services/
    chat_pipeline.py   text + voice turn orchestration
    prompt.py          system prompts, history token budget, yo/ig base-lang map
    rate_limit.py      per-user rpm + one concurrent generation (Redis)
    storage.py         S3-compatible object storage (MinIO in dev)
    models_gateway/    one thin adapter per model service:
                       llm + code_llm (OpenAI-compatible, streaming), stt,
                       tts, translate, embeddings, health; provider.py is
                       the MODEL_PROVIDER switch (our pods or OpenRouter)
  workers/     arq jobs: embed_message, generate_chat_title
  builder/     the app builder (docs/builder.md): the turn loop, its six
               tools, the sandbox drivers (E2B, local) and manager, the AI SDK
               UI message stream encoder, model routing by stage
```

## REST (all under /v1)

```
POST /auth/signup /auth/login /auth/refresh
GET  /chats                POST /chats
GET  /chats/:id/messages   DELETE /chats/:id
POST /attachments          GET  /attachments/:id
GET  /search?q=
POST /keys                 GET  /keys              DELETE /keys/:id
POST /images/generations   POST /videos            GET  /videos/:id
POST /audio/speech         POST /audio/transcriptions
GET  /tools                POST /tools/:name
GET  /builder/projects     POST /builder/projects/:id/chat   (docs/builder.md)
GET  /health               GET  /health/models
```

## Developer API keys

Anyone building on Vivid generates their own key in the web app under
**Settings → Developer**, and reads the endpoint list at `/docs` (Swagger UI,
generated from the routes so it cannot drift). A key is sent as
`Authorization: Bearer vivid_...` and resolves beside the user-token path in
`api/deps.py`, so it works on every `/v1` endpoint the apps use.

```
POST   /keys        generate; the secret is in this response and nowhere else
GET    /keys        this account's keys, secrets excluded
DELETE /keys/:id    revoke (idempotent)
```

Three rules hold the design together:

- **A key acts as its own service account, never as the person who made it.**
  The chats, attachments and browser sessions it creates belong to the key, so
  a partner's traffic never lands in the developer's own sidebar and revoking
  one key cannot touch another's data. `api_keys.owner_user_id` records the
  human, and is what `/keys` scopes to.
- **A key cannot manage keys.** Those three routes take `get_session_user`,
  which refuses an API key. Otherwise a leaked key would outlive its own
  revocation: the holder would mint a replacement first.
- **Only the SHA-256 hash is stored**, so a lost key is unrecoverable by
  anyone, us included. Revoke it and generate another.

Keys minted before this flow existed carry the `vk_` prefix and a null owner.
They still authenticate; only the current prefix is ever issued. The CLI is
still there for a key that should not belong to any account:

```bash
python -m app.scripts.create_api_key "Acme browsing" --max-sessions 5
```

## Generation and tools over HTTP

The apps reach image, video, voice and tools through the chat pipeline, where
the model decides to call a tool. A partner has no model in the loop and no
websocket, so the same capabilities are exposed directly. Shapes follow
OpenAI's where one exists, for the same reason `/chat/completions` does.

```
POST /images/generations    prompt -> a stored image (url, or b64_json)
POST /videos                prompt -> 202 {id, status}; renders in the background
GET  /videos/:id            poll until status leaves "pending"; the clip arrives here
POST /audio/speech          text -> audio/wav, or a stored url
POST /audio/transcriptions  multipart audio -> {text, language}
GET  /tools                 what this deployment can run right now
POST /tools/:name           run one; returns the observation and any files it made
```

Everything generated is stored as an attachment, the same record the chat path
writes, so a file made through the API appears in `/artifacts` beside the rest.
It belongs to the caller rather than to a chat, which is why
`attachments.chat_id` is nullable.

**Video is a job, everything else answers directly.** A clip takes minutes,
which no proxy will hold open. Nothing renders on our side: `POST /videos`
forwards to the upstream and stores the mapping, and the caller's poll is what
asks upstream how it is going. So there is no worker to run and a backend
restart loses nothing. The first poll that finds it finished downloads and
stores the clip; later polls return that same file.

**A failed tool is a 200.** The assistant reads a failure as an observation and
recovers from it, and a caller running its own loop needs the same thing. A
tool that does not exist here is a 404, because that is the caller getting the
name wrong. `GET /tools` is shorter when a service is unconfigured, so read it
rather than hard-coding names.

`GENERATION_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` and `TOOL_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` are their
own buckets, separate from the chat limit: these are priced per call by an
upstream, where a chat turn is one request no matter how much it does.

## Partner browsing (`/v1/browser`)

```
POST   /browser/sessions            open (optionally authenticated + scoped)
GET    /browser/sessions            this key's live sessions
DELETE /browser/sessions/:id        close (idempotent)
POST   /browser/sessions/:id/goto   navigate
POST   /browser/sessions/:id/snapshot
POST   /browser/sessions/:id/text
POST   /browser/sessions/:id/act    click | type | submit
GET    /browser/sessions/:id/storage_state
POST   /browser/tasks               managed loop; SSE with {"stream": true}
```

Rules worth knowing before changing this code:

- **Session ids are server-issued and owned.** vivid-tools keys sessions by an
  arbitrary caller-supplied string, which with partners sharing the service
  would let anyone drive anyone else's browser. `services/browser_sessions.py`
  issues ids, stores the owner, and **fails closed** if Redis is down.
- **Authenticated sessions must declare `allowed_domains`.** They carry live
  cookies, and the controller picks navigation from page text an attacker can
  write. Enforced in the backend and again in vivid-tools.
- **Quota before capacity.** A key's concurrent sessions are checked before the
  browser pool is asked, and the pool now refuses rather than evicting its
  oldest session — an evicted authenticated session is a lost login.
- **The controller loop lives in `services/browsing.py`**, shared by the chat
  `browse` tool and the tasks endpoint, so the two cannot drift.

## Errors

Every REST error carries a stable code, plus a request id echoed in the
`X-Request-Id` header:

```json
{"error": {"code": "quota_exceeded", "message": "...", "request_id": "req_..."},
 "detail": "..."}
```

`detail` is a deprecated mirror kept so the current frontend, which reads it
directly, keeps showing real messages. Drop it once the frontend uses the SDK.

## Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pip install -e ../sdk/python
pytest
```

No Postgres needed: the registry runs on a fake Redis and vivid-tools is
stubbed. `tests/test_sdk_contract.py` drives the published SDK against these
routes over an ASGI transport, so the two cannot drift apart silently. The
full-stack path stays `make smoke`.

## Websocket

Connect: `ws://…/ws?token=<access token>`

client → server: `message`, `audio_start` + binary frames (or base64
`audio_chunk`) + `audio_end`, `cancel`
server → client: `token`, `tool_status`, `transcript`, `audio_chunk`, `done`,
`error`

Generation survives a client disconnect: the reply is still saved, so it is
there on reload.

## Notes

- **GPUs down?** `MODEL_PROVIDER=openrouter` plus `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` sends
  the assistant, the coding agent, the `/v1` proxy, speech-to-text and
  text-to-speech to OpenRouter instead of the pods. History, prompts and
  budgets stay in the backend (the history clamp just uses the live model's
  window), and nothing above `services/models_gateway/provider.py` can tell,
  so no client or frontend change is involved. `LLM_PROVIDER`,
  `CODE_LLM_PROVIDER`, `ASR_PROVIDER` and `TTS_PROVIDER` override it per
  service. Restart the backend and the worker, then check `/v1/health/models`
  with `Authorization: Bearer $HEALTH_TOKEN`: every entry reports its
  `provider`, and an `openrouter` entry shows the balance, `audio_ready`
  (transcription needs $0.50 on the account) and the key's expiry. Without
  the token the route is ok flags only, and nothing a user sees — error
  toasts, message rows, `/v1` responses — names the upstream. Translation
  for yo/ig stays on its pod and falls back to English while that is down.
- **Images and video** come from OpenRouter's `/images` and `/videos`
  endpoints through the `generate_image` and `generate_video` tools
  (`services/models_gateway/media.py`). The pods have no such model, so these
  ignore `MODEL_PROVIDER` and exist only while `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set.
  The bytes go on the reply as an attachment (`kind` image or video) and the
  model is told only that the file is attached, never given the data. The
  Artifacts page lists them, and the apps have Images and Videos pages.
  Nothing on OpenRouter generates media for free; `OPENROUTER_IMAGE_MODEL`
  defaults to the cheapest usable one.
- yo/ig follow the RunPod design: the LLM answers in English, the ASR server's
  `/translate` does the language work, history stores the English turns.
- TTS routes through the ASR server's `/speak` (keeps its `clean_for_tts`
  number-spelling) unless `TTS_BASE_URL` is set.
- `EMBEDDINGS_URL` unset → search uses Postgres full-text only; set it once the
  embeddings service exists (adapter: `services/models_gateway/embeddings.py`).
- `web_search`/`news` run `services/search.py`: the question is rewritten into
  `SEARCH_QUERY_VARIANTS` keyword queries (voice transcripts make bad queries),
  searched in parallel, merged, reranked (`RERANKER_URL`, else Tavily's order)
  and the top page is read when its snippet is thin. Measure a change with
  `make search-eval f=transcripts.txt` (one transcript or `tool web_search(…)`
  log line per file line).
- Deployment is `deploy/` plus `.github/workflows/vivid-backend.yml`: a push to
  `main` runs the suite, builds the backend, sandbox and vivid-tools images,
  pushes them to GHCR and rolls them out on the EC2 instance, rolling back if
  `/v1/health` does not answer. `deploy/README.md` has the instance setup and
  the list of GitHub secrets.
- Every table carries `client_id` (default `vivid_web`) — the B2B hook. Do not
  build the B2B flow yet.
